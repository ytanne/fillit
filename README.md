# fillit
This is the story of a piece of Tetris, one little square and a dev walk into a bar...

# Description
This is a project about developing an algorithm that will fit tetriminoes provided as an input to the smallest possible square in shortest amount of time. Tetriminoes are the object pieces from well-know game "Tetris".

In this project, a student will learn how to solve recurring problems (finding an optimal solution among many other possibilites). It is also great opportnunity to practice data structure implementation in practice.

# Installation
Clone the repository to a directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ytanne/fillit.git fillit
```
Run make to get fillit executable.
```
cd libft && make && make clean
```

# Usage
After installing, you can test the code by storing custom valid tetriminoes in file, and providing it as an input. Firstly, lets create a test case by storing the following tetriminoes in a file `test.fillit`:
```
....
.##.
##..
....

....
.###
...#
....

...#
...#
...#
...#

.#..
###.
....
....
```
Then pass this file as a standard input to the obtained executable:
```
./fillit test.fillit
```
That will give us following output:
